      The overview chart can be controlled by clicking the following elements:
      <ul>
        <li><em>a bar or its label</em> zooms the x-axis to that bar</li>
        <li><em>the background</em> resets zoom to the entire chart</li>
        <li><em>the x-axis</em> toggles between linear and logarithmic scale</li>
        <li><em>the chevron</em> in the top-right toggles the the legend</li>
        <li><em>a group name in the legend</em> shows/hides that group</li>

    <h1><a>understanding this report</a></h1>

    <p>
      In this report, each function benchmarked by checkasm is assigned a section of its own.
      <span class="no-print">The charts in each section are active; if you hover your mouse over data points and annotations, you will see more details.</span>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The chart on the left is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">kernel density estimate</a> (also known as a KDE) of time measurements.
        This graphs the probability of any given time measurement occurring. This function is estimated from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">Log-normal
        distribution</a> fitted to the measurement data. The peak corresponds to the most likely execution time (point estimate).
      </li>

      <li>
        The chart on the right is the raw data from which the kernel density estimate is built.
        The <em>x</em>-axis indicates the number of loop iterations, while the <em>y</em>-axis shows measured execution time for the given number of loop iterations.
        The line behind the values is the linear regression estimate of execution time for a given number of iterations.
        Ideally, all measurements will be on (or very near) this line.
        The transparent area behind it shows the 95% confidence interval for the execution time estimate.
        Note that, for technical reasons, when <code>bench_run()</code> is called multiple times in the same
        function, only the last call's measurements are shown in this chart.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Under the charts is a small table. They show the results of a log-space linear regression
      run on the measurements displayed in the right-hand chart.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Adjusted cycles</em> is the estimated number of CPU cycles taken by a single function
        call, after subtracting the overhead of the measurement loop and function call itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Adjusted time</em> is the estimated time taken by a single function call, after
        normalization by the estimated hardware timer tick frequency, and includes extra variance
        from the uncertainty of the tick rate estimation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Raw cycles</em> and <em>Raw time</em> reflect the raw data collected from the underlying
        hardware counter, before subtracting the measurement overhead.
      </li>
    </ul>
